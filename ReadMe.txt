Project Description
#####################
This project is the game of "Five-in-a-Row" which is also sometimes known as "Gomoku". The objective is to get five consecutive X's or O's,
either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. This uses a 2D array to represent the board and a stack to keep track of moves such that
they can be undone.
